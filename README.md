# Currency Chatbot

This project is about a currency conversion chatbot which was developed using Dialogflow.


### API

- To convert currency based on user inputs, first I used free currency converter api which worked fine. But sometimes it shows server down and the bot won't respond which is not helpful for the user.

- So I decided to scrape the data from google search using Beautiful Soup which worked perfectly.
